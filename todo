# Things to do

[X] Get the project stepper displayer wrapper to work with missing projects
[X] Move the Logging from the displayer wrapper to actual recorders
[X] Add spreadsheet logger
[X] Save comments via auto/manual feedback recorder
        Within AGradingFeature it calls:
            projectDatabase.getAutoFeedback().recordAutoGrade(this, result);
            projectDatabase.getManualFeedback().comment(this);
        setScore in AGradingFeature calls comment();
            setScore is never called? That means that manual feedback is never used. We only care about auto feedback
        So the idea is to use the conglomerate recorder as the auto feedback recorder.
    [X] Remove GradingFeatureWrapper
    [X] Get feedback saving correctly
    [X] Make ConglomerateRecorder be an auto feedback
    [X] Integrate it (Setters)
[X] Don't skip on missing projects
[X] Work on wrappers
[ ] Use configuration for GraderData folder (ProjectDatabaseWrapper line 30)
