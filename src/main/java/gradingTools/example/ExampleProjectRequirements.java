/**
 * This is an example on how to define requirements and test cases for an assignment. You just extend the
 * {@link FrameworkProjectRequirements} class, define a nullary constructor (no arguments), and within it add due dates,
 * features, and restrictions by calling the respective methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>addDueDate</li>
 *     <li>addFeature</li>
 *     <li>addRestriction</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * These project requirements are to be used with the "Test Data/Example Bulk" folder.
