Notes from grading features:
----------------------------------
Package declarations:
  -- Missing package declaration in 1 out of 1 classes 

Equal avoid null:
  -- Literal should be target rather than argument of equals(Ignorecase) 4 number of times

Has proper isPalindromeMethod method:
  -- - Method isPalindrome did not complete within 3.0seconds.  Likely an infinite loop.


Has proper countUniqueCharacters method:
  -- - Method countUniqueCharacters does not generate the correct output.


Program runs computation specified by the user:
  -- Incorrect output for computation check if palindrome
  -- Does not continually ask for new Strings and calculations to run

  Total Score: 90.3
