Notes from grading features:
----------------------------------
Has proper isPalindromeMethod method:
  -- - Method isPalindrome did not complete within 3.0seconds.  Likely an infinite loop.


Has proper countUniqueCharacters method:
  -- - Method countUniqueCharacters does not generate the correct output.


Program runs computation specified by the user:
  -- Incorrect output for computation check if palindrome
  -- Does not continually ask for new Strings and calculations to run

  Total Score: 90.0
